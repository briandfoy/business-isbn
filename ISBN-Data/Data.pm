=head1 NAME

Business::ISBN::Data - data pack for Business::ISBN

=head1 SYNOPSIS

see L<Business::ISBN>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This data is current as of October 2008. At that time, the publisher
codes  9990000-9999999 or 999000-999999 had not been fixed, although
they had been proposed. I do not include them in the data. Some
regions, including India (93), Gabon (99902), and Congo (99951) have
country codes but no publisher codes. They still have entries even
though you won't be able to validate any ISBNs assigned in those
regions.

Business::ISBN uses this "data pack" to do its work.  You can update
Business::ISBN::Data independently of the main module as the various
ISBN organizations assign new publisher codes.  The ISBN agency lists
these data at http://www.isbn-international.org/converter/ranges.htm .

Note, that as a historical artifact, some countries are actaully
language areas. For instance, country code 2 is "French", and includes
several French-speaking countries.

Simply install this module over the previous version.  The module is a
Perl data structure, so you can install it with CPAN.pm, or simply
copy it to the right location.

Older versions of this module did not declare a version, and will work
with whatever version of Business::ISBN you have despite anything the
Makefile.PL might say. Some versions tracked the version of
Business::ISBN. Starting in October 2008, the version is the date of
the module update (as YYYYMMDD).

If you make updates, please send them to me so I can include them in
future releases.
